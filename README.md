# Memory Game

A card memorization game. The project was created on React + Vite.

# How to play?

At the beginning of the game, select the grid of the card from the possible options (2x2, 4x4, 6x6), then click on the "Play" button and the game begins. Your task is to find all pairs of cards.

# Launching the game

The launch is performed by the following commands:
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/memory-game.git -- clone the repository to any folder convenient for you
- npm install -- install dependencies
- npm run dev -- running the game in development mode

Or follow the link to gh-pages.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
